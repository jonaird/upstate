## [0.6.6] - Upstate is deprecated
See my [writeup](https://medium.com/@jonathan.aird/upstate-is-now-changeemitter-a-flexible-highly-composable-alternative-to-changenotifier-c837e6db493f) for more info.

## [0.6.5] - Minor improvements

 - Each state element now has a reference to the root state element.
 - State values will only notify listeners if the new value is different than the old one.

## [0.6.4] - added ability to change state value without notifying parents

To set a state value without notifying parents: 
`stateVal.quietSet(newVal);`

## [0.6.3] - added ability to change state value without notifying listeners

To set a state value without notifying listeners: 
`stateVal.silentSet(newVal);`

## [0.6.2] - Added homepage

## [0.6.1] - Added api docs and more flexibility for type safety

## [0.6.0] - Added ability for custom state objects plus first breaking change
 
First breaking change: StateBuilder no longer has a child argument. Passing a child to a builder
is used in cases where high performance is needed in the case that the builder is being called
on every frame for example. Instead of doing this, consider storing a stream in upstate and use a 
stream builder.

## [0.5.2] - Added option for complete type safety

## [0.5.1] - updated readme and small changes to enable state models

## [0.5.0] - initial beta release
